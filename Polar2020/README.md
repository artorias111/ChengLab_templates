## Scripts in this directory

Author: Shriram
all scripts without the `.sh` extension are written well, you can use them. 
Ones with the `.sh` extension are written for my personal use, and I  didn't add comments, you're free to use them if you can figure them out. Let me know if you want any help in running these scripts.
