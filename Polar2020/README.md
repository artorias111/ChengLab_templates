## Scripts in this directory

Author: Shriram Bhat (sb65@illinois.edu)\
All scripts without the `.sh` should be straightforward to use (see the comments in the files to run the script). \
Scripts with the `.sh` extension are written for my personal use, and I  didn't add comments, you're free to use them if you can figure them out. \ 
Let me know if you want help running these scripts.
